# StudentGradeJAVA

Write a java program that allows the user (the teacher);

- To enter the number of students is in the class

- Create an array_1 with the size of students in the class to enter integer data

- Then, ask the user to enter each student’s grade and save them on the created array_1.

- Then, create an array_2 with the size of students in the class to enter “letter grade of the students”

- Then calculate the “letter grade” of each student based on the array with integer data and save them in to an array_2 as a letter grade

- Calculate average grades of students based on the array_1 data and print it on the screen

- Calculate how many students receive grade “A” based on the array_2 data and print the number on the screen if no one, print (“none of the students has grade A”) message

- Calculate how many students receive grade “B” based on the array_2 data and print the number on the screen if no one, print (“ none of the students has grade B” ) message

- Calculate how many students receive grade “C” based on the array_2 data and print the number on the screen if no one, print (“ none of the students has grade C” ) message

- Calculate how many students receive grade “D” based on the array_2 data and print the number on the screen if no one, print (“ none of the students has grade D” ) message

- Calculate how many students receive grade “F” based on the array_2 data and print the number on the screen if no one, print (“ none of the students has grade F” ) message

- A if grade >= 90

- B if grade >= 80

- C if grade >= 70

- D if grade >= 60

- E if grade < 60
